        <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>Back when I was a freshman in high school I joined the agriculture program. I loved the program and the FFA, and to achieve the FFA State Degree I needed to have a small-scale business. I had a mower and older neighbors so I decided I would help them for a small fee and start that as my business. I did it for my whole highschool career and as I grew older I expanded my busniess and still continue it to this day as a side project.</p>
